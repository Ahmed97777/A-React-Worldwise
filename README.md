**Note:** This project was created as part of my journey to deepen my understanding of React. While I already had a foundation in React, Jonas Schmedtmann's online course on Udemy (The Ultimate React Course 2023: React, Redux & More) played a pivotal role in expanding my knowledge and enhancing my skills.

React + Vite :
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
Currently, two official plugins are available:
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
